<h1>SUDOKU-SOLVER in C</h1>



<h3>1- Introduction</h3>

This projects is about solving sudoky puzzles with two different approaches. The first one consists in iterating through
a space of possible solutions until finding one that is valid, while the second one uses propositional logic to define a set
of constraints that a SMT-solver will use to find a satisfiable solution.

<h3>2- Background</h3>
